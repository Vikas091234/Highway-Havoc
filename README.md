# 🚗 Highway Havoc

**Highway Havoc** is a fast-paced, browser-based arcade game built with **JavaScript**, **HTML5 Canvas**, and **CSS**. Choose from 4 unique modes — Classic, Combat, Survival, and Truck — and dominate the road with sharp reflexes, firepower, and power-ups!

---

## 🎮 Game Modes

### 1️⃣ Classic Mode

A pure endless runner. Dodge traffic and survive as long as you can. No enemies, no weapons — just skill and speed.

Arm your car with **weapons** and blast through enemy vehicles while dodging traffic. Power-ups enhance your firepower and protection. Can you survive the chaos for 2 full minutes?

### 3️⃣ Survival Mode (2 Minutes)

Hold out for 2 minutes using limited lives and strategically timed **shields** and **boosts**. Enemies appear in clusters, and the road dynamically changes. The longer you survive, the harder it gets.

### 4️⃣ Truck Mode

Take control of a **massive truck** and **ram through enemies** instead of dodging them. This mode focuses on destruction rather than survival.
